## Task 5 - Model Building


* Created ML Models for various objectives 

  - HHI score
  - Employee Growth %
  - Status (Acquired or Closed)

* Performed Hyperparameter tuning to improve results
* Used PyCaret AutoML Library to create models and quickly get results.
* Best Model obtained from PyCaret is choosen to re-train and deploy with same hyperparameters using scikit-learn to reduce the slug size of dependencies on Heroku (PyCaret is huge package to deploy it on Heroku).
