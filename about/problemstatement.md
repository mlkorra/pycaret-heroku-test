## Background

More than 100 million startups are launched per year, which is about 3 startups per second. But more than 50% of startups fail in the initial four years.The United States of America is a leading country by the number of startups and has almost three times more startups than most of the countries combined. Startups are vital for economic growth in all countries. They bring new ideas, knowledge, innovation and ample employment opportunities. Anticipating the success rate of startups will help investment firms to provide better investment advice and investors to look for potential growth of the firm and invest. On an average **9 out of 10** startups fail and several reasons are responsible for that.

## The Problem

The highly volatile nature of startup firms make it difficult to interpret the success rate and due to this intensive nature it becomes inevitable to use the potential of machine learning to build a **predictive model**.
